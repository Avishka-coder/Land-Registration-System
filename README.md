# Land-Registration-System
A Land Registration System is a computerized or digital platform that helps manage land-related records and legal documents. The system ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in managing land ownership, transactions, and related legal activities. It replaces traditional paper-based systems and aims to reduce errors, fraud, and bureaucratic delays.
The purpose of this project is to create an efficient, transparent, and accessible land registration system that can manage property titles, land transactions, and associated documentation.
